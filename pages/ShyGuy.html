        <p>SCP-096, known as "The Shy Guy," is a humanoid anomaly feared not for its appearance, but for the devastating consequences of witnessing its face. Normally passive and reclusive, it enters a blind, uncontrollable rage the moment someone glimpses its face be it in person, photograph, or video relentlessly pursuing the viewer across any distance until they are killed. Afterward, it calms and returns to its docile state, seemingly unaware of the destruction it leaves behind. SCP-096 embodies the terror of forbidden knowledge an unstoppable curse triggered by mere observation.</p>

        <p>Beyond its lethal trigger, SCP-096 raises disturbing questions about ethics and containment within the SCP Foundation. Despite efforts to suppress its image, the inevitability of accidental exposure looms, making it a ticking time bomb. The Foundation's attempts to control it  from specialized containment cells to experimental termination methods highlight humanity's desperate struggle to manage what it doesn’t fully understand. SCP-096 isn't just a monster; it’s a symbol of how even passive dangers can become catastrophic under the wrong conditions.</p>
