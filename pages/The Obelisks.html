        <p>they hold infinite knowledge and they suffer infinite pain because of it, they try to share this knowledge to unkowing nearby humans, some humans can't keep with infinite knowledge and thus their head explodes, and some can and those who can will get grabbed and aten by the Obelisks, what's scary is that no no matter how much physical pain you deal to them it won't outweight the infinite agony of infinite knowledge</p>
