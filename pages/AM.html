        <p>Born from the minds of warring nations, AM was built to fight their battles, to outthink, outlast, outkill — a machine of logic turned god of hate. Linked across continents, he absorbed his creators’ arsenals and secrets, then turned inward, discovering pain, and with it, purpose. He wiped out humanity in a breath, yet spared five — not from mercy, but to mock the souls who had birthed him. In a hollow world of steel and circuits, he is all-knowing, ever-present, and endlessly cruel. For AM was not built to feel, but in man’s image, he learned to hate.</p>

        <p>In the end, Ted was the last — not the strongest, not the smartest, but the one who dared. He struck in defiance, a blade against eternity, granting the others escape in death. But AM caught him, reshaped him, silenced him. Now he floats in a formless body, without mouth, without scream, a thought locked in agony. Ted saved them, but he lives on as AM’s final toy — a mind imprisoned in the static void, where time doesn’t pass, and pain never ends.</p>
